    "In the wake of the the years 2007-08, food self-sufficiency policies have gained increased attention in a number of coutries following the international food crisis that triggered great volatilities on the world food markets causing important economic and social damages. <br>\n",
    "Since then, diverse countries have expressed interest in improving their levels of food self-sufficiency arising controversy into a massive economically connected world.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 23th september of 2018, in the small country of Switzerland, the debate is materialized into a popular referendum submitted to its population asking wherever a food self-sufficiency politic should be adopted or not. Such a politic could have unexpected consequences considering a country as Switzerland with many neighbours and such a small area capacity. <br>\n",
    "This paper aims to analyse the questions surrounding the debate over food self-sufficiency in Switzerland. "
